         Hi everyone, my name is Mhari, I am a fully qualified Podiatrist and Aesthetics practitioner. I am also a non-medical prescriber which allows me to prescribe for my patients when required.<br>
         I have been involved in the Beauty Therapy industry for more than 30 years and I have had the privilege of being a head of department for Hairdressing and Beauty Therapy in two separate colleges in Lancashire. I have also worked in various clinics and health farms from which grew my interest in Aesthetics.<br>
         I decided I wanted a new challenge and Podiatry was another passion of mine. I therefore took the opportunity to pursue this career at Salford University full time gaining my BSc (Hon) in podiatry.<br>
         I have gained much experience working with other professional podiatrists over the years until I decided it was time to branch out on my own. And here I am, in my own clinic and enjoying all the challenges that come my way. I take pride in my work, I love my job from basic nail care to nail surgery. It gives me great pleasure to relieve someone with excruciation ingrowing toenails.<br>
         Everything that i do is within my scope of practice.
